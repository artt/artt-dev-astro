title: Hello! I'm Art

I spent more than a decade studying in the US.
After having earned degrees in Economics and Applied Mathematics,
  I joined the Bank of Thailand's macroeconomic forecasting team
  before having a privilege of serving as the personal assistant to Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob.
After his term ended in 2021,
  I transitioned to my current role as a researcher at the
  [Puey Ungphakorn Institute for Economic Research](https://www.pier.or.th).

I have a wide range of interests since there are so many fascinating things to explore!
This space is a way for me to keep track of
  things I think about, things I find interesting, and the projects I have going on.
