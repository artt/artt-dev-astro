> NongHed is a chatbot who could provide you
with up-to-date economic and financial data for Thailand.

# Background

When I started my job at the Bank of Thailand,
  one of the first things I noticed is how data-oriented the organization is.
Questions like, "What was last month's export growth?"
  or "What was the current account last year?" consistently pop up.

While most people could recall these numbers off the top of their head
  (or at least have some rough numbers),
  newcomers often find it hard to recall these numbers
  and would have to flip through their giant folders to look up the numbers.
The same goes for "infrequently asked numbers" that even veterans sometimes find troublesome.

## Existing solution(s)

### BOT Statistics

Indeed, the Bank of Thailand has a ginormous
  [statistics portal](https://www.bot.or.th/English/Statistics/Pages/default.aspx)
  with tens of thousands of series covering everything
  from [total loans in the banking system](
  https://www.bot.or.th/App/BTWS_STAT/statistics/BOTWEBSTAT.aspx?reportID=155&language=ENG)
  to [quantity of pineapples exported each month](
  https://www.bot.or.th/App/BTWS_STAT/statistics/BOTWEBSTAT.aspx?reportID=748&language=ENG).
So theoretically anybody could look up the numbers from there.

The problem? The statistics portal is ginormous.
Unless you know exactly which table number to look at,
  you'll likely find yourself poking around different tables
  and end up unsure which one is the series you want.

### Friends

Next up are friends.
You use your favorite instant messaging means (LINE, Facebook Messenger, etc.)
  and ask your veteran friends or people in the respective teams to help you look it up.
Of course, the problem with this approach is that your friend might not always be there for you.


# Comes along NongHed

NongHed was meant to be that friend who would always be there for you
  (to provide Help with Economic Data, of course).
The idea is that the user could simply ask the chatbot
  with these questions you'd normally ask your friends,
  and NongHed will answer them for you, 24/7.

NongHed is available on both
  [LINE](https://lin.ee/biOThlf) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nonghed.bot),
  and you can start chatting with him (her?) right away.


## Architecture

When you chat with NongHed,
  your request goes through respective platform's messaging API,
  which then forward your requests
  to Google's [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/).
From there, simpler requests like "Hi" or "What's your name"
  are handled directly by Dialogflow,
  while data-related requests are forwarded to an API hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

This backend is written in Python and handles everything
  from updating data
  to parsing dates (Dialogflow doesn't do a particularly good job of handling quarterly dates)
  to doing requested calculations.

## Data

The data NongHed has comes from several sources.

### Bank of Thailand's API

The Bank of Thailand has made its statistics (yes, those tables) available
  through [BOT API](https://apiportal.bot.or.th/bot/public/) since 2017.
This is a huge step forward in making public data accessible,
  and I sincerely thank the people who have made this possible.

BOT API itself is easy enough to use, but is intended for power users
  (read: people who can code.)
So one can think of NongHed as a user-friendly frontend for BOT API.

Making more than 20,000 series in BOT API available to NongHed users
  could make things as confusing for users,
  so I chose only series that are queried frequently
  (currently there are around 40 series).
Adding more series from BOT API is as simple as adding a row in a `.csv` file.

For faster results, data from BOT API are pulled automatically every day
  into a local copy.

### Other government agencies

Huge as it is, BOT API only contains data compiled by the Bank of Thailand.
Important economic series like
  GDP (compiled by [NESDC](https://www.nesdc.go.th/nesdb_en/more_news.php?cid=155))
  or inflation (compiled by [MOC](http://www.price.moc.go.th/))
  are not included in the BOT API.
As a result, these data have to be pulled separately via available means.

### Other sources

Otherâ€”mostly liveâ€”data are scraped through many sources.
  and I guess we'll have to be sneaky-sneaky about that ;)

# Looking forward

I hope to add more useful features for NongHed in the future.
Suggestions are more than welcome!
If you have any suggestions or questions,
  please send them to [`nonghed.bot@gmail.com`](mailto:nonghed.bot@gmail.com).

All of the cloud services I use for this project
  (LINE Official Account, Facebook Messenger, Dialogflow, Heroku) are on a free tier.
This means there are certain limitations
  like number of messages that NongHed can handle in an hour,
  or an uptime that might not be guaranteed.
If you find NongHed helpful and would like to support continued development,
  please feel free to [support NongHed](https://nonghed.artt.dev/#support)!
