I recently worked on a project that requires
  the use of IMF's [Data Services](https://datahelp.imf.org/knowledgebase/articles/630877-data-services).
Although the data is very good,
  the [documentation for the API](https://datahelp.imf.org/knowledgebase/articles/667681-using-json-restful-web-service)
  is a bit lacking.[^1]
When [asked](https://datahelp.imf.org/knowledgebase/articles/1968408-how-to-use-the-api-python-and-r),
  IMF staff points to [this tutorial](http://www.bd-econ.com/imfapi1.html),
  which goes into details on how to use the API using Python.
I thought it would be useful to have a more conceptual explanation of how the API works, so here it is.

[^1]: There's another, perhaps more useful, article [here](https://datahelp.imf.org/knowledgebase/articles/2005918-api-response) which was not linked from the main page.

# Find your Dataflow

IMF's Data Services has a number of "dataflows" available.
These are simply IMF's lingo for "databases".
Examples are:
* [Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS)](https://data.imf.org/?sk=9D6028D4-F14A-464C-A2F2-59B2CD424B85&sId=1514498277103)
* [International Reserves and and Foreign Currency Liquidity](https://data.imf.org/?sk=2dfb3380-3603-4d2c-90be-a04d8bbce237)
* [International Financial Statistics](https://data.imf.org/?sk=4c514d48-b6ba-49ed-8ab9-52b0c1a0179b)

To get the list of available dataflows, make a request to [the URL below](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/Dataflow):

```
http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/Dataflow
```

:::note
  For the remainder of this article,
    we'll replace the first part of the URL
    
  ```
  http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc
  ```

  with `…`. So the above URL becomes `…/Dataflow`.
:::


Let's say we're looking for data on international reserves.
We can simply find the key word and we'll have the following:

```json
{
  "@id": "DS-IRFCL",
  "@version": "1.0",
  "@agencyID": "IMF",
  "@isFinal": "true",
  "@xmlns": "http://www.SDMX.org/resources/SDMXML/schemas/v2_0/structure",
  "Name": {
    "@xml:lang": "en",
    "#text": "International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity (IRFCL)"
  },
  "KeyFamilyRef": {
    "KeyFamilyID": "IRFCL", // [!code highlight]
    "KeyFamilyAgencyID": "IMF"
  }
},
```

Note the `KeyFamilyID` field (`IRFCL` in this case).
This is the database ID we're looking for.

# Find your Dimensions

Once you have the dataflow ID, you can find out more about the data structure by looking at [`…/DataStructure/IRFCL`](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/DataStructure/IRFCL).
More specifically, what we need are the dimensions of the dataset.
Take a look in `Structure` > `KeyFamilies` > `KeyFamily` > `Components` > `Dimension` and we'll see something like this

```json
[
  {
    "@conceptRef": "FREQ", // [!code highlight]
    "@conceptVersion": "1.0",
    "@conceptSchemeRef": "IRFCL",
    "@conceptSchemeAgency": "IMF",
    "@codelist": "CL_FREQ",
    "@codelistVersion": "1.0",
    "@codelistAgency": "IMF",
    "@isFrequencyDimension": "true"
  },
  {
    "@conceptRef": "REF_AREA", // [!code highlight]
    "@conceptVersion": "1.0",
    "@conceptSchemeRef": "IRFCL",
    "@conceptSchemeAgency": "IMF",
    "@codelist": "CL_AREA_IRFCL",
    "@codelistVersion": "1.0",
    "@codelistAgency": "IMF"
  },
  {
    "@conceptRef": "INDICATOR", // [!code highlight]
    "@conceptVersion": "1.0",
    "@conceptSchemeRef": "IRFCL",
    "@conceptSchemeAgency": "IMF",
    "@codelist": "CL_INDICATOR_IRFCL",
    "@codelistVersion": "1.0",
    "@codelistAgency": "IMF"
  },
  {
    "@conceptRef": "REF_SECTOR", // [!code highlight]
    "@conceptVersion": "1.0",
    "@conceptSchemeRef": "IRFCL",
    "@conceptSchemeAgency": "IMF",
    "@codelist": "CL_SECTOR_IRFCL",
    "@codelistVersion": "1.0",
    "@codelistAgency": "IMF"
  }
]
```

<div id="dimensions" />

This tells us that this dataset has four dimensions:
1. `FREQ`
2. `REF_AREA`
3. `INDICATOR`
4. `REF_SECTOR`

# Find your CodeList

For each of these dimensions (aside from `FREQ`), you can find which values are available by looking at the corresponding codelist at `…/CodeList/[@codelist]`.
For example, you can view which indicators are in this dataset by going to [`…/CodeList/CL_INDICATOR_IRFCL`](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CodeList/CL_INDICATOR_IRFCL).
The applicable values could be found under `Structure` > `CodeLists` > `CodeList` > `Code`.

```json
[
  {
    "@value": "IARO_BP6_EUR",
    "Description": {
      "@xml:lang": "en",
      "#text": "Assets, Reserve assets, Other reserve assets, Euro"
    }
  },
  {
    "@value": "IARO_BP6_XDC",
    "Description": {
      "@xml:lang": "en",
      "#text": "Assets, Reserve assets, Other reserve assets, National Currency"
    }
  },
  {
    "@value": "IARO_BP6_USD",
    "Description": {
      "@xml:lang": "en",
      "#text": "Assets, Reserve assets, Other reserve assets, US Dollars"
    }
  },
  // ...
]
```

# Get your data

Now that we know the dimensions and the possible values for each dimension, we can finally get the data.
IMF's Data Services has a method called `CompactData`.
Here's a template: `abc`

```
…/CompactData/[@dataflow]/[@dimension1].[@dimension2].....[@dimensionN]
```

For the last part, we need to put in a code for each dimension, separated by a dot (`.`).
The order of the dimension has to follow [the dimensions](#dimensions) found earlier.

## Basic usage
For the most basic usage (although not the most common one), specify one item per dimension.
For example, to get a monthly data on foreign exchange reserves for Thailand whose source is the monetary authority,
  use the [following link](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH.RAFA_USD.S1X):

```
…/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH.RAFA_USD.S1X
                    ^ ^  ^        ^
  Dimension         1 2  3        4
```

## More than one item in a dimension
To add more than one code in a dimension,
  use the plus sign (`+`) to separate each item within a dimension.
For example, to get the aforementioned data for both Thailand and Malaysia,
  use the [following link](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH+MY.RAFA_USD.S1X):

```txt /\+MY/
…/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH+MY.RAFA_USD.S1X
```

## All items in the dimension
To include *all* codes in that dimension, don't put anything in that dimension.
For example, to get the data for *all* countries,
  use the [following link](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CompactData/IRFCL/M..RAFA_USD.S1X):

```txt /../
…/CompactData/IRFCL/M..RAFA_USD.S1X
```

:::note
We still need to put the dot (`.`) to indicate that we're skipping that dimension.

If the dimension you want to exclude is at the end, you can omit the last dot.
In other words, `…/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH.RAFA_USD` is equivalent to `…/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH.RAFA_USD.`.
:::

You can, of course, combine these strategies.
For example, to get annual data for all countries for two indicators, you use the [following URL](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CompactData/IRFCL/M..RAFA_USD+RAFAGOLD_USD):

```
…/CompactData/IRFCL/M..RAFA_USD+RAFAGOLD_USD
```

## Specifying start and end periods
If we're only interested in data for a certain period,
  we can specify the start and end periods using the `startPeriod` and `endPeriod` parameters.
(We can also specify only one of them.)
These can be in the form of `YYYY` or `YYYY-MM`.
For example, to get the data for Thailand from July 2010 to 2012,
  use the [following link](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH.RAFA_USD?startPeriod=2010-07&endPeriod=2012):

```txt /?startPeriod=2010-07&endPeriod=2012/
…/CompactData/IRFCL/M.TH.RAFA_USD?startPeriod=2010-07&endPeriod=2012
```

# Limitations
IMF's Data Services has a rate limit of
* 10 requests in 5 second window from one user (IP)
* 50 requests per second overall on the application.

The request should also not return more than 3000 series.
(This limit could be found by the [`GetMaxSeriesInResult`](http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/GetMaxSeriesInResult) method.)

# Wrapping up

That's it!
This should cover all the basics of using IMF's Data Services.
There are more methods available to get things like metadata,
  but I'll leave that for some other time.
